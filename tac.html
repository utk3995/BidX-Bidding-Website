  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>bootshop is not an  Auctioneer</strong>.<br>
  Although bootshop is commonly referred to as an  online auction web site, it is important to realize that we are not a  traditional &quot;auctioneer.&quot; Instead, the Site acts as a venue to allow  certain persons sell and buy certain products styles anytime, from anywhere, in a  variety of pricing formats, including a fixed price format and an auction-style  format commonly referred to as &quot;online auctions&quot; or  &quot;auctions.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>bootshop's Role and  Responsibilities</strong>.<br>
  Spiro.com features two types of marketplaces,  and bootshop's role and responsibilities vary in each such marketplace. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>bootshop  Direct Marketplace and bootshop Certified Merchant Marketplace</strong>.<br>
  bootshop itself is the seller of the products  offered in bootshop Direct Marketplace. bootshop undertakes responsibility for all  aspects of the transaction and the product listing, including product  descriptions, identification of quantities, establishment of starting and  maximum bid prices, establishment of reserve requirements (if any) and  shipping.  bootshop also sells through bootshop  Certified Merchants (UCMs) are bootshop approved third-party merchants who sell  products on the Site. In this program, the Certified Merchant is the seller of  the product. To ensure bootshop buyers the ability to shop in a private and secure  environment, every bootshop Certified Merchant must go through a thorough  application process including verification of bank and trade references before  they are approved to list products on the Site. bootshop Certified Merchants are  established businesses (both small and large) whose performances are monitored  to ensure that buyers receive the appropriate bootshop service levels. These  Certified Merchants list their items directly and assume responsibility for all  aspects of their product listings including product descriptions,  identification of quantities, establishment of starting and maximum bid prices,  and shipping. Although bootshop does not own, warehouse, ship or otherwise manage  any inventory or goods offered by bootshop Certified Merchants, those merchants who  do not meet bootshop's service standards can and will be removed from listing  products on the site. bootshop handles all payment processing for orders from these  merchants and bootshop's Customer Care department provides assistance for all  issues to ensure a positive bootshop experience.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Spiro.com Payments</strong>.<br>
  bootshop currently accepts credit card/debit card  payments for orders in the bootshop Direct Marketplace and the bootshop Certified  Merchant Marketplace. bootshop honors Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American  Express. You warrant that any payment method selected by you when placing a bid  shall enable you to make full and immediate payment for the item(s) chosen, if  your bid becomes the winning bid. In the event that the chosen payment method  does not enable you to make full and immediate payment for any reason,  including without limitation insufficient funds or credit decline, bootshop may in  it sole and absolute discretion cancel your bid. In such case, bootshop may in it  sole and absolute discretion (but shall not be required to) designate the next  highest bidder (meeting the applicable minimum bid or reserve requirements) as  the winning bidder. At bootshop's sole discretion, but without any obligation,  alternate payment methods may be arranged with the product purchaser(s) in the  case where a payment method has been declined. The next card on file will be  charged if your order declines. <br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>bootshop Reservation of  Rights</strong>.<br>
bootshop retains the right, but does not have the obligation, to immediately halt any auction or product sale, prevent or restrict access to the Site or the Services or take any other action, including but not limited to canceling any affected orders, in case of technical problems, objectionable material, inaccurate listings, typographical errors in a fixed price or auction listings, inappropriately categorized items, auction inaccuracies, product inaccuracies, unlawful items, items, procedures, or actions otherwise prohibited by the procedures and guidelines contained on the Site, or for any other reason in the sole and absolute discretion of bootshop, and to correct any inaccurate listing, auction inaccuracies, product inaccuracies, inappropriately categorized items or technical problems on the Site.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Your Transactions and  Obligations</strong>.<br>
  Bidders and buyers create different  obligations by accessing the Site and using the Services.<br>
  <br>
  In the Certified Merchant Marketplace, the  seller must sell the product to the highest bidder that meets or exceeds the  minimum price. Similarly, if a Certified Merchant offers to sell an item by  means of the Buy Now feature, the seller must sell the item to any buyer who  elects to purchase the item through the Buy Now offer. For bidders, a bid or  Buy Now election is a legal offer to buy the product. Once the transaction  closes, both the buyer and seller are obligated to complete the transaction.<br>
  <br>
  By entering into this Agreement and bidding  on a product or making a Buy Now purchase, you agree to complete the  transaction as described by this Agreement. You acknowledge that by not  fulfilling these obligations, your action or inaction may be legally  actionable.<br>
  <br>
  If an item purchased in the bootshop Direct  Marketplace or bootshop Certified Merchant Marketplace is being shipped to a state  in which sales tax liability exists, bootshop must charge sales/use tax on the  transaction. bootshop will accept resale certificates only if submitted before the  transaction closes. In the Certified Merchant Marketplace, you agree that it is  the seller's and the buyer's responsibility to determine whether sales or use  taxes apply to the transactions and to collect, report and remit the correct  tax to the appropriate tax authority. You also agree that bootshop is not obligated  to determine whether sales or use taxes apply and is not responsible to  collect, remit or report any sales or use taxes arising from any transaction.  bootshop must charge sales tax on all Illinois sales. Other merchants may charges  tax in states they are liable to.<br>
  <br>

  </strong>Your password may be used only to access the  Site, use the Services, electronically sign your transactions and review your  completed transactions.
